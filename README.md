# Tic-Tac-Toe

The Tic-Tac-Toe project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript creates a simple yet engaging web-based game. The HTML defines a 3x3 grid for the game board, while CSS styles the grid and provides visual feedback for player moves, distinguishing between X and O symbols. JavaScript handles the core game mechanics, including alternating turns between players, checking for winning combinations or a draw, and resetting the game for a new round. This project is an excellent way to practice fundamental web development skills, particularly DOM manipulation, event handling, and conditional logic.
